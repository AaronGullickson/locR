\title{Create a basic \link{httr2} query request to the \emph{Chronicling America} API}
\usage{
create_basic_request(
  query,
  items_page = 20,
  combine_type = "OR",
  throttle_rate = 80/60,
  retries = 10
)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{Either a character string or a vector of character strings. Searching
on multiple words can be conducted by either separating words with a space in
a single character string or providing a vector of character strings.}

\item{items_page}{The number of items returned per page of results. The
default is 20, but for large searches, it will be more efficient to put
more items on a single page. This value should never exceed 1000.}

\item{combine_type}{A character string equaling "OR", "AND", or "Phrase". When
searching multiple words, this argument identifies whether to search for any
of them ("OR"), all of them ("AND") or the exact phrase ("PHRASE").}

\item{throttle_rate}{The throttle rate as searches per second. The default
uses \code{80 / 60} which is the specified crawl rate for collections.}

\item{retries}{The number of retries to attempt when the search fails because
of an error.}
}
\value{
An \link{httr2} request that can be further modified.
}
\description{
Produce a \link{httr2} request to the \emph{Chronicling America} API that can then be
further modified before processing.
}
\details{
See \href{https://www.loc.gov/apis/json-and-yaml/}{here} for more information
about the \emph{Chronicling America} API for json. This is the API introduced
in 2024 which will eventually replace the older API.

The search automatically is conducted on pages and uses the advanced
search type option, which will allow users to utilize more advanced search
patterns.

This request also identifies several common http errors that affect the API
as transient errors so that they will not disrupt retries.
