\usage{
loc_search_pages(query, year_start = 1756, year_end = 1963, facets = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{Either a character string or a vector of character strings used
to search pages. The format here should be identical to \link{create_basic_loc_request}.}

\item{year_start}{An integer giving the starting year for the search. If not
provided, defaults to earliest date of 1756.}

\item{year_end}{An integer giving the ending year for the search. If not
provided, defaults to latest date of 1963.}

\item{facets}{A set of facets to further restrict the search, as defined in \link{add_facets}.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters that are passed on to \link{create_basic_loc_request}.}
}
\value{
a \link{tibble} of items, with one item per row.
}
\description{
Retrieve all items from a \emph{Chronicling America} search and place them into a
\link{tibble} dataset.
}
\details{
It is best to use year restrictions and/or facets to reduce the total volume
of the search. Searches with more than 100,000 total items will likely be
refused by the API. It is also generally useful to increase the \code{items_page}
parameter from its default of 20 to reduce the problem of "deep paging"
across results and reduce the overall number of requests. The \code{items_page}
cannot be larger than 1000. A value of 500 often works well.

The returned results from the json are formatted into a \link{tibble} with only
the following values:
\itemize{
\item item url
\item date
\item publisher
\item location: county, state, and year
\item text snippet
}

Users who want different values will returned would need to adjust the
internal function \code{process_row} which does this work.

\examples{

loc_search_pages("banana", year_start = 1910, year_end = 1915,
                 facets = c(location_state = "florida", language = "english"),
                 items_page = 500)

}
